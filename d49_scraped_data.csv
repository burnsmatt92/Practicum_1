best to encourage our students and staff to be healthy For the 20232024 school year we have implemented many things into our Health and Wellness program This Fall we welcomed Landsharks Running Club into our school The students had a great time going to practices building camaraderie and feeling the sense of accomplishment at the competitions A second round of Landsharks has continued this Spring and we hope to continue it in the 20242025 school year If you have a child that loves to run or just simply has lots of energy Landsharks may be a great fit for them We also know that with living in Colorado comes unpredictable weather and freezing temperatures which causes us to stay inside for recess To help keep our minds engaged we have purchased and put together Indoor Recess Carts These carts contain a variety of ageappropriate games and activities for students to choose from when they cannot go outside We have found they have been helpful in building concepts like taking turns and working together Grades 35 are thoroughly engaged in the games while grades K2 love something simple like coloring To help encourage our staff to stay healthy we started with ensuring they were able to stay hydrated Getting the daily amount of water as a teacher can be difficult some days Therefore we provided each staff member with a water bottle with motivational statements that helped encourage them to drink more water We also know the winter months can be hard to get exercise so staff had the opportunity to participate in the Falcon Zones Biggest Loser Competition We were able to provide incentives to those winners that competed throughout the zone Our Health and Wellness committee has many things yet to accomplish and we look forward to implementing them in the 20242025 school year Comments 1 At BRES we have worked hard to make sure our traffic pattern is safe for both students parents and staff Here is a brief movie that explains how dropoff and traffic patterns

updated with information in regard to the transition to Elearning and Eworking for District 49 staff Expand All District Intentions and Work Expectations during COVID19 related restrictions of E49 March 26 2020 During this E49 season related to school district and societal restrictions caused by COVID19 District 49 in accordance with districtwide contingency guidance will maintain our daily working posture  actively pursuing of our mission To be the Best Choice to Learn Work and Lead with continued efforts for Providing Educational services ie all education delivery services Providing Physical Mental Emotional supports to students  staff Providing Supports to students dealing with food insecurities Pursuing Cultural and Strategic Objectives as previously established District 49 continues to employ with normal pay all staff this year with both new and enhanced processes for employee safety District 49 will make decisions and pursue actions that are consistent with State and Federal guidance to limit opportunities for the spread of COVID19 through large gatherings To fulfill these intentions it should be known that Each employee continues to be employed as a resource in their lanes of ability and expertise for routine and project work according their annual work calendar Accordingly each employee has the responsibility to be available to fulfill requested work routines on a daily basis Each employees work routine shall be determined by their supervisors and may include an eWork routine a normalinfacility routine or a combination of both As a result time off sick days etc should be requested and taken and tracked as normal when an employee intends to not be available District 49 leaders BoE  SLT Chief Officers Zone  Department Leaders will proactively pursue necessary adjustments to its planned activities and related budgets directing their staff in the process to best fulfill these intentions in a manner that maximizes positive impacts and minimizes negative potentialities Sincerely Brett Ridgway Chief Business Officer E49 Elearning Protocols for Educators March 25 2020 Dear D49 Educators Thank you for your patience as we work through the disruptions caused by the COVID19 crisis Every aspect of our society has been impacted by this international pandemic education is no exception As we know teaching is undergoing a dramatic shift to accommodate the Governors executive order that Colorado schools suspend inperson learning through April 17thwhile still providing meaningful learning at a distance For some of our colleagues proceeding with Elearning means rough passages through unknown waters For some it will be smooth sailing For all of us though this season will disrupt how we connect with our students and each other But we will meet this challenge by following our mission to learn work and leadas we embark on a season of Elearning Eworking and Eleading that we call E49 As we adjusted to the onslaught of snow this winter we anticipated the need for Elearning and we planned for it Now well use those plans for a different purpose so we ask you to consider the following guidance as we set our plans into action THE ELEARNING TRANSITION Our first day back from spring break Monday March 30 will be a day of work to finalize your learning plans directions and expectations Our goal will be that educators will communicate the first weeks schedule lessons and assignments by the afternoon of Monday March 30 We will repeat this rhythm as we continue our elearning process in the weeks ahead We will maintain a workweek routine that begins with Monday as a professional day for collaboration planning setup and communication with families followed by four learning days to work with students Our Communications Team is developing a web page for each schools website to share communication with families about our commitments and expectations for elearning Schools will post weekly updates for families here and educators should generally provide students with the weeks lessons and assignments by no later than Tuesday morning each week going forward To reduce confusion and preserve trust with our families during E49 we will expect all assignments to be completed by midnight of the day due unless teachers make special arrangements for unusual circumstances While we expect that educators will work during their regularly scheduled school hours we ask that individual teachers or teaching teams designate set office hours for responding to student and parent questions providing feedback and clarifying assignments Our expectation is that teachers are available in real time for at least three hours each day with two hours in the morning and another hour later in the day in case questions arise During those office hours we expect educators to be attentive and responsive to studentfamily questions and concerns Since this will be a shift in practice for most teachers students and families we encourage you to bring lessons and assignments online slowly balance screentime expectations and be cautious not to overload or overstimulate MANAGING ELEARNING We encourage teachers to use the apps websites and learning management systems that students and families are already familiar with and are accustomed to using Specifically teachers and others should be confident using the videoconferencing element in Schoology Big Blue Button but please do not use the Zoom platform for student interactions Zoom does not permit minors to set up accounts and we dont have the bandwidth to establish a new district architecture for Zoom to offer that platform at scale We are working to validate Google Meet Hangouts for student use but we can verify that Schoology videoconferencing is approved and integrated already Dont feel pressure to jump into using new platforms just because they are now free In fact avoiding taking on new systems or expecting students to learn new platforms unless you have consulted with your team and principal and are certain its worth it Reach out to colleagues and technology teacher leaders in your school and access supports at the district level regarding approved eresources and curriculum Since special education CLDE and gifted education providers along with counselors and other special service providers will continue to serve students and families plan time to collaborate and consult with those colleagues and providers We do not plan to use guest teachers substitutes to support E49 Rather schools should plan that gradelevel or department teams will collaborate to ensure instruction for all students continues should one or more teachers within a team become ill and unable to plan and deliver instruction If exceptional circumstances make that plan impractical we will consult with teachers and other leaders to create a workable plan The D49 EdTech team has created a resource bank of exemplar elessons and delivery ideas in a shared Schoology group D49 ELearning Support Access Code 3J5DV4JBHR7H3 Our primary concern is protecting learning time while respecting the needs of families and students during this challenging time Our communications team is creating a district resource page for highlevel information about public policy and district plans Along with the resource pages for each of our school websites these materials will give families useful information to support the elearning process We will provide an update on where to find and how to access these pages as they are finalized Please work with your building site managers to keep these pages up to date Thank you for your attentiveness your courage and understanding as we launch E49 as an extension of the excellence that makes us D49 Sincerely Amber Whetstine and the Learning Services Team E49 Guidance for Individual Contact with Students March 25 2020 One of the challenges we face for operating E49 is the issue of direct interactions with individual students Some of our services such as tutoring interventions translating and counseling normally take place in semiprivate settings which are hard to replicate in online environments We dont want to create risk for our students or staff so we are developing this new guidance to address the unique needs of individualized support in online settings Our policy guidance prohibits all secret contact and most private contact with students as well as friending or following on social media That guidance protects both students and teachers so we should meet our policy expectations even in this new era of Elearning and Eservice Some selected procedural guidance from regulation GBEBR1 STAFF CONDUCT AND RESPONSIBILITIES  PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES  Prohibited Conduct Initiating or extending contact with a student beyond the school day or outside of class times for the staff members personal purposes Maintaining private contact with a student outside of school by phone email Instant Messenger or Internet chat rooms social networking Web sites or letters beyond homework or other legitimate school business without including the parentguardian Interacting with students over social media for noneducational purposes when that interaction Is hidden andor secretive Is loosely connected or has no connection to school Is not disclosed or is actively concealed from the employees supervisor Is not disclosed or is actively concealed from the students parents Any other action or activity similar in nature to those listed above So as we enter this new mode of interacting in E49 some simple guidance would be Strongly prefer group over individual interactions Ensure that onetoone or private interactions are disclosed to parents ideally by parent preapproval A best practice is to copy a parent on any onetoone communication Never worry alonewhen in doubt consult a supervisor or colleague before proceeding These guidelines protect students from the extremely rare possibility of misconduct by staff members and they protect staff members from the extremely rare possibility of an illegitimate accusation by a student Either rare instance is so destructive that its worth our extra diligence and vigilance to prevent the worst from happening Thank you for the courage to teach and serve We dont take it for granted and we appreciate your diligence and professionalism as we all learn new ways to do the next right thing Peter Hilts Chief Education Officer Get in Touch 10850 E Woodmen Road Peyton CO 80831 17194951100 Download on the App

Technical Rocky Mountain Classical Academy SEARCH OUR SITE School District 49 Weather Conditions Weather Conditions Page Navigation Weather Conditions Get Closure Updates Get Delay  Closure Updates District 49 makes decisions to preserve student and adult safety during inclement weather Winters in the Pikes Peak region are full of surprises especially in District 49 which spans 133 square miles of suburban and rural terrain Outdoor temperatures often plummet sometimes turning a wetbutwarm 60degree winter thaw into a dangerous slip and slide While some areas might escape heavy snowfall others might become dangerous as gusting winds produce drifts Each year as winter weather arrives District 49 leaders implement a comprehensive process to monitor local conditions and decide weather delays or closure We offer several options for getting notifications about delays and closures  Anyone in our community can explain their opinion about a weatherrelated call by completing the Winter Weather Communications Survey which opens after each call is made Remember every parent based on local conditions retains the right to decide when its unsafe to send their child to school Closure and Delay Q  A Can I keep my student home if District 49 stays open Posted by Yes Parents make the final call for each students safety Per board policy EBCER parents are asked to help make decisions regarding their own child If in a parents judgment it is too hazardous to send their child to school the child should be kept at home The child will not be penalized for his or her absence or tardiness and will be given ample opportunity to make up missed assignments When inclement weather causes bad road conditions a parent may waive an absence by contacting their students school to report the absence as weather related Comments 0 95 When does District 49 make the final call for a closure or delay Posted by We begin to announce and broadcast our decision at approximately 445 am Often we make the final weather call early in the morning the day of a delay or closure But when the forecast is severe enough we may issue a decision the night before When conditions are uncertain and further observations are necessary ground crews start evaluating road conditions at midnight and then the transportation team begins a comprehensive review at about 2 am The determination to close the district is always made by 5 am and often by 430 am We make our decision as early as possible in recognition that parents students and staff need time to adjust to the schedule change In addition the transportation department must cancel or delay bus routes which typically begin picking up students at around 545 am When we delay and continue monitoring it is to review plowing progress and road conditions between 56AM and make a close or proceed decision by 6AM We do not send additional messaging if we proceed on the delay schedule If we do decide to close we will announce that decision via all our standard channels the D49 website FB Twitter and local media no later than 630 AM So if you dont see a closure by 630 AM we are operating on a delay schedule And since mountain regions often produce unstable weather conditions may rapidly deteriorate or improve after the district makes its final call Comments 0 74 While determining roadway safety does District 49 consider passenger cars Posted by Yes We consider cars other types of private vehicles school buses and maintenance equipment District leaders expect bus drivers to transport children safely to and from school so the district only remains open when the transportation team is confident that bus drivers can complete their routes with no accidents While assessing road conditions the districts ground crews and transportation team know there are more than just buses transporting students on the roads They consider that some people choose to drive vehicles that are difficult to operate such as models with rearwheel drive or older cars with balding tires If a parents vehicle is unsafe to drive given their local road conditions they can take advantage of the districts busing services or excuse their students absence When weather patterns deteriorate quickly we trust everyone to drive their vehicles with care by maintaining appropriate distances operating at reasonable speeds and staying alert Comments 0 46 Would the district close solely due to cold temperatures Posted by If roads are safe schools stay open unless it gets dangerously cold Safety is never just about wind chill Mix up the right combination of temperature humidity and wind in the atmosphere and we can get icing conditions at 30 degrees Fahrenheit and above Whats more sometimes conditions can go from safe to icy in less than an hour Some areas in our district change faster than others Since we must delay or close school almost three hours before the first class there is plenty of opportunity to make a good faith decision that turns out wrong We do our best to err on the side of safety When temperatures plummet we pay attention to the thermometer barometer anemometer and any other ometers that can help us predict the weather When the combination of ambient temperature and wind speed pushes the effective temperature wind chill down to 18 degrees we know we are in the danger zone for frostbite Once the windchill nears 18 degrees we know that exposed skin can suffer frostbite in 30 minutes Cold weather sweeping in with humidity snow ice and winds our decision is fairly straightforward Cold weather is one of the factors in our decision about what constitutes unsafe conditions We encourage you to use the National Weather Services online chart and calculator to explore and calculate wind chills so you can make informed decisions before your family heads outside and into cold weather Comments 0 77 What factors contribute to District 49 calling a delay versus a closure Posted by The most important factor is our observation or reasonable forecast of dangerous driving conditions The district is focused on ensuring students receive as much inclassroom opportunity as possible Prior to delaying or canceling a day of educational services the transportation team considers many factors and consults with many resources The team works to make the best judgment call for our part of El Paso County Twohour delays are helpful when theres a foreseeable change such as rapidly warming conditions When a twohour delay is deemed most appropriate everything is postponed two hours unless parents are specifically notified about an activity by their school As always parents are asked to keep in contact with their schools administration for updates on programs such as the rescheduling of activities Comments 0 43 Since District 49 is so large why doesnt it close by zone Posted by Closing by zone is logistically challenging and many of our students and stakeholders travel between zones There are several issues that make closing by zone difficult For one the district provides a portfolio of schools across its four zones to ensure every student finds great opportunities With choice enrollments a student may live in one zone but attend a school in another zone Whats more the district operates a centralized dispatch center and bus depot which means drivers and support personnel must travel between zones Comments 0 77 During a twohour delay what happens to bus stop pickup times Posted by Your bus stop time is exactly two hours later than your regular bus stop time Comments 0 122 Weather Notifications We offer several options for getting notifications about closures and delays  Colorado Weather Links El Paso County Snow Plowing Learn more about the priorities established on roads and streets within the

Updates 2020 Graduation Info Elearning Academics The content below was updated on and is current as of April 1 2020 Thank you for your patience as we work through this new situation As we know teachers are undergoing a dramatic shift to accommodate the Governors executive order that Colorado schools suspend inperson learning through April 30thwhile still providing meaningful learning at a distance On March 30 District 49 reopened for learning under the new conditions of operations required by the coronavirus health emergency For the time being D49 will pursue excellence as E49 which acknowledges our move as a district to an Elearning and Eworking model Thank you for walking with us as we navigate our new landscape and season of learning created by this epidemic We are already seeing significant impacts as we transition into distance learning or elearning Our primary concern is protecting learning time while respecting the needs of families and students during this challenging time District 49 has set up some expectations for our teachers that will help you navigate ELearning Remote teaching and learning will take many forms But you can expect that there will be communication progress monitoring andor feedback between teachers and students While ELearning is not the same as the regular classroom environment it can provide some continuity when school is interrupted It will also serve to further prepare our students for todays digital world Teachers as well as administrators and other certified staff members will be available by email or other digital learning spaces such as Google Classroom Schoology etc While not online continuously teachers will monitor email and other communication with students and parents regularly throughout the school day Expand All This is NOT home schooling We are providing our community with educational content and learning support WHAT WE ARE DOING All schools have plans in place to facilitate elearning Many of our curriculum partners and vendors are making resources available to our teachers in an online platform so that educators and students will be able to continue to access teaching and learning while we operate as E49 We are finalizing a plan to support families who may need assistance with computers and internet access Watch for email and other communications regarding this process in the upcoming week We encourage our families to support their students as they complete their assignments although we want to reinforce it is our responsibility as educators to continue to facilitate learning during this period Elearning will roll out districtwide on Tuesday March 31 to allow our educators time to finalize their preparations with a day of work on March 30 Your schools will reach out directly to explain their procedures and expectations Please watch for these communications at the end of this week and beginning of the week of March 30 as we return from spring break We are preparing a resource page on each of our school websites where you will find useful information to support the elearning process We will provide an update on where to find and how to access these pages when they are finalized How You Can Support Elearning at Home Please provide a quiet learning environment as free from digital and personal distractions as possible Checkin with your child about

Communicate about your students attendance and if they will be absent due to illness or other emergencies Be aware of deadlines expectations and norms Look for schooldistrict communications and respond when appropriate Our primary concern is creating productive learning time while respecting the needs of families and students during this challenging time We will work with our families as needed and will continue our posture of serving the larger D49 Family while we diligently prepare our campuses for a safe return when we resume normal operations Please stay alert for messaging through all our channelsthe D49 App our social media feeds and our district website where you will find updates and reliable information about coronavirus Thank you for your attentiveness partnership trust and understanding ELearning Expectations of Teachers Our goal is educators will communicate the weeks schedule lessons and assignments by each Monday afternoon We will repeat this rhythm as we continue our elearning process in the weeks ahead We will maintain a workweek routine that begins with Monday as a professional day for collaboration planning setup and communication with families followed by four learning days to work with students Each schools website has a page dedicated to ELearning information and resources Schools will post weekly updates for families here and educators should generally provide students with the weeks lessons and assignments We will expect all assignments to be completed by midnight of the day due unless teachers make special arrangements for unusual circumstances Individual teachers or teaching teams will designate set office hours for responding to student and parent questions providing feedback and clarifying assignments Our expectation is that teachers are available in realtime for at least three hours each day with two hours in the morning and another hour later in the day in case questions arise During those office hours we expect educators to be attentive and responsive to studentfamily questions and concerns Please contact your teacher for specific times Some teachers will be using the apps websites and learning management systems that students and families are already familiar with and are accustomed to using English Language Learners ELL students will receive support through their CLDE teachers Daily checkins and resource classes will be offered to students depending on their language level For a complete overview of our ELearning plan visit httpswwwd49org Page8468  If you are a limited English proficient

generate possible solutions for the administration of the PSAT and SAT tests which offer unique roles in Colorados system in terms of scholarships and college entrance Additional information will come from CDE as it becomes available CDE intends to engage with the US Department of Education to address implications including those related to federal accountability and will complete waiver documentation as necessary Anthes said Im a big fan of accountability and transparency in public education but we will simply have to forgo incredibly useful data on student achievement for a year to help contain the virus said Colorado Gov Jared Polis Right now students families and educators need to be focused on doing everything they can to keep families safe and stable It is clear that COVID19 will put extraordinary stress on our education system for the coming weeks and months In order to ensure our schools and educators are able to spend as much time as possible on online instruction in a difficult situation I support the decision to pause assessments and school accountability for this year only Making the decision to pause testing now allows schools and districts to concentrate on determining ways to deliver continued instruction to the extent they are able during this unprecedented disruption in education Anthes said The Department will continue working with schools and districts that are already identified for improvement to help support instruction including options for instruction during and after school closures CDE has compiled resources about Coronavirus 2019 COVID19 for schools and districts on its website here httpwwwcdestatecoussafeschools  For further information on how the assessment pause will impact the states accountability system please visit this webpage State Testing CMAS The administration of endoftheyear assessments including the Colorado Measures of Academic Success CMAS will be paused for the remainder of the 201920 school year due to extensive school closures throughout Colorado to prevent the spread of COVID19 Colorado Education Commissioner Katy Anthes announced today With the extraordinary actions we are taking to prevent the spread of COVID19 its clear that we need to press pause on our CMAS tests this year Commissioner Anthes said Students and educators need to feel a sense of stability and normalcy before state tests can be administered and produce valid results This also means we plan to pause our school and district state accountability system as it relates to state assessments for a year Schools will outline their workflow and tools for families on their web pages on D49org Links to individual school elearning pages will be updated as soon as possible These will be located on somewhere this page Falcon

Middle School Evans International Elementary School Remington Elementary School Springs Ranch Elementary School Expand All Attendance We know its strange to get up and go to school without leaving your house but thats what we expect you to do Just as your teachers will go to work at some location in their house you should set up a consistent location to start your day and proceed with your work It will help if you pick a place that isnt distracting or in the middle of other activity Were going to keep taking attendance by tracking if you participate in learning each day so here are four ways you can show us youve been in school and in a class For elementary students we expect you to engage with your classroom teacher every day and then interact with your other teachers specials enrichments at least weekly For secondary students we expect you to engage with each of your teachers in one of the following ways Turn in an assignment between 900 am and midnight Message your teacher or interact with them in some way over Google Classroom Schoology or another learning system Participate in a group lesson or discussion with your teacher Complete an assignment or activity with a trackable online component like a quiz in Schoology lessons in ST Math reading in Lexia or something else your teacher assigns Thats it If you do any of those things on a school day then youll get credit for attending that day If you dont do any of those things well count you absent If youre absent again well contact you and your parents to make sure you can and will be able to attend Engagement Please remember you are the student so we are counting on you to take responsibility to be present in classes If you have a question or concern with a teacher or assignment it is important that you advocate for yourself first by contacting your teacher directly If you still have concerns then include a parent if you need to add them to the discussion ELearning is hard so you might be more tired or confused than you expect Give yourself breaks but dont procrastinate or things will pile up too fast Thanks for being flexible and patient as we work things out together Teacher Illness If a teacher is sick or unable to be online they will let students andor parents know Student Illness If a child is sick and unable to complete eLearning activities parents should email the teacher to let them know Students will be responsible to make up the work when they are well However we will all need to be flexible and understanding as we use eLearning to address individual student needs Home

variety of affordable and appealing foods that meet the health and nutrition needs of students Nutrition departments are regulated by the federal government and part of that regulation is to operate as a selffunded enterprise within a school district This means that nutrition services does not take any taxpayers funds from the district to operate the meal programs Proposition FF Healthy Meals for All Children Expand All Prop FF Additional Clarity will Inform D49 Decision on State Meals Program School District 49 is looking closely at multiple important factors to determine how we will participate in the voterapproved Proposition FF which would provide meals at no cost for all students The program now known as Healthy Meals for All Children HMAC seems like a nobrainer But as with so many governmentfunded programs the details matter So far program managers at the state level have not ironed out how to implement this program The biggest concern for D49 and other districts in Colorado is how HMAC will impact atrisk students School districts receive federal funding for students participating in the Free and Reduced price lunch program which also qualifies districts for funds that go toward educational programs and Title I schools As the HMAC program is designed participating districts could lose millions of dollars in atrisk federal funding for education and meals Districts across Colorado are appropriately concerned that the stateprovided free meals will drastically reduce enrollment into the Free and Reduced program which means less funding for educating atrisk children We saw this exact pattern develop during the freemealsforall phase of the COVID19 pandemic in that changing economy many families who could qualify for free and reduced benefits did not apply because congressapproved funding covered all meals As a result D49 experienced a 30 percent decrease in free and reduced participation By providing meals at no cost to children of families that can afford lunches there is the significant potential to lose funding for educational programs and support to lowincome students These atrisk students would qualify for free meals in the current Free and Reduced program D49 leadership is asking itself is it the right call to opt in to an unproven meal program if the end result means reducing our ability to provide educational opportunities experiences and achievements of atrisk students D49 is waiting on the state to clarify procedures and program details that will provide a way to continue federal funding for educating our atrisk students School districts have until the start of the next school year to decide on how to participate and must opt in or opt out each year D49 plans to make a decision by the end of May Colorados Proposition FF will help pay for school meals by limiting state tax deductions for those making more than 300000 per year  meaning those taxpayers would pay more in taxes That revenue would be available to school districts that choose to offer free school meals for all students Proposition FF requires districts to apply for whats known as the Community Eligibility Provision program to get federal funding but D49 and other districts dont qualify for CEP Proposition FF passed with 55 percent of the state vote in the November 2022 election It was much closer in El Paso County with a win by 3120 votes 5056 to 4944 Nutrition Services Resources View Menus Comments 1 Prepay School Meals Prepay school meals online using this portal Comments 1 Meal Assistance Program Information Comments 1

Committee  2016 3B Business Office Overview District 49 strives to remain a trustworthy recipient of taxpayer investment Throughout continued growth the districts financial outlook remains fundamentally sound Statement of Purpose The District 49 business office creates a firm foundation for our district as good stewards of stakeholder trust and taxpayer investment to this community We accomplish this through exceptional customer service efficient and effective processes with comprehensive strategic planning Working as a team we commit to communicating effectively and treating each other respectfully in all of our interactions From a business perspective we benefit from inspiring teamwork initiatives and professional development Highly qualified financial staff members work in close collaboration with educational leaders That collaboration is a key contributor to the districts solid financial position When its community asks for more efficiency the district responds The values with which we manage our district financially reflect the values of our community The districts culture is ensuring we operate responsibly with taxpayer dollars From a financial perspective we point to a couple of items District 49 like all public entities is subject to an annual financial audit by an independent audit firm For the last couple of years Hoelting and Company Inc an external auditor has consistently provided opinions stating District 49 finances are sound and follow appropriate accounting principals We have the sophistication to selfprepare the audit report titled Comprehensive Annual Financial Report which includes relevant statistical information to supplement the financial data normally presented All school districts are measured against each other and against an expectation of fiscal responsibility by the Office of the State Auditor District 49 compares favorably Among our peers the 20 largest school districts in Colorado District 49 has consistently ranked in the top five for overall fiscal health We do this with one of the lowest levels of funding from the state formula and with relatively little override funding from local taxpayers District 49 is one of the most efficient districts in Colorado David Trautenberg Chief Financial Officer Phone 7194951145 Silvia Cano Executive Assistant to the Chief Financial Officer Phone

Know District 49 has adopted The I Love U Guys Foundation standard response protocols for K12 schools The standard response protocols SRP are a uniform planned and practiced response to any incident The SRPs are used by all Pikes Peak Region school districts to allow for a consistent response by local law enforcement agencies The five SRPs are simple and achievable Hold Secure Lockdown Evacuate and Shelter  Here is a quick look at the three most common During a HOLD the school clears the hallways and keeps students in their current classroom This allows the school staff to respond to a variety of situations including medical emergencies extreme messes and some student behavior issues D49 also uses Holds in partnership with the El Paso County Sheriffs Office K9 Unit for service dog training Schools will be doing business as usual during a Hold In most cases families will not receive a message from a school after a Hold has been issued During a SECURE the perceived danger is outside of the school  like police activity or wild animals Faculty move students and activities inside and secure the perimeter While a SECURE response elevates situational awareness it also allows for learning to continue with minimal classroom interruptions Schools operate daily in a nearsecure status Perimeter doors are always locked and every visitor is screened at each buildings entrance Visitors use intercom systems to notify front offices of their arrival and then sign in at the office or other designated location Security personnel often greet high school visitors During a LOCKDOWN

information campaigns to structure the survey and determine the content of the various options The eight aspects are Start Date Teacher Professional Development Fall Break Veterans Day Thanksgiving Break Christmas Break Spring Break GraduationEnd of School Of the eight calendar options Christmas Break and the End of YearGraduation were items with high initial consensus There was no presurvey support for shortening Christmas break or extending the school year past Memorial Day so those two options were presented for confirmation or comment in the survey For the other six calendar items consensus centered around keeping the particular area as it is currently implemented or an option for adjusting the calendar The options for change are presented on the second page with representative comments Respondents were also asked to share how important each area of the calendar is to them MaintainChange Legend Importance Legend  Strongly Agree  Strongly Agree  Agree  Agree  Neutral  Disagree  Strongly Disagree START OF SCHOOL 58 support to maintain  high importance Representative Comments DISTRICT 49 SHOULD MAINTAIN A START DATE WITHIN TWO DAYS OF AUG 1 I really value the early start with the 2 weeks in Oct and Winter Break and Spring Break DISTRICT 49 SHOULD CHANGE THE START DATE TO ONE WEEK LATER WITHIN TWO DAYS OF AUG 7 Find any solution to starting August 1st Lose 2 weeks from the two breaks etc or go into June August 1st is too soon to begin FALL BREAK 72 support to maintain  very high importance Representative Comments DISTRICT 49 SHOULD MAINTAIN A TWOWEEK FALL BREAK IN THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER Please honor the tradition of our school district for many years by keeping our two week fall and spring breaks It is something special to our district which not only keeps teachers here but also attracts them If we lose this we may lose many great teachers who can get paid more in other districts especially with teacher shortages coming our way As a parent it is also important to have this time with my daughter thank you DISTRICT 49 SHOULD CHANGE THE CALENDAR REDUCING FALL BREAK TO ONE WEEK For families with both parents working full time we can easily make plans for summer break but the two week breaks in between becomes increasingly difficult to schedule Teenage crime also seems to go up with too much time off during these breaks DISTRICT 49 SHOULD ELIMINATE FALL BREAK Just to reiterate Eliminate Fall Break THANKSGIVING BREAK 80 support to maintain  high importance Representative Comments DISTRICT 49 SHOULD MAINTAIN A FULLWEEK THANKSGIVING BREAK FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS Many people travel for Thanksgiving and the week long break allows them to get a good visit with family DISTRICT 49 SHOULD CHANGE THE CALENDAR HOLDING SCHOOL ON MON  TUE OF THANKSGIVING WEEK If there is a full week or two off in October there is no need for a full week off in November for Thanksgiving It puts it having 3 months in a row having vacations thats too much Its hard for kids to maintain their routines because of that PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT no clear consensus  moderate importance Representative Comments DISTRICT 49 SHOULD MAINTAIN SCHOOL  ZONE AUTONOMY FOR PROFESSIONAL WORK NO STUDENTS DAYS I have no issues calendar wise I like it how it is I prefer to keep it this way DISTRICT 49 SHOULD CHANGE ITS CALENDAR TO UNIFY PROFESSIONAL WORK DAYS Have all of the calendars match to include grade school middle school and high school for those parents who have children in more than one school VETERANS DAY 50 support to maintain  moderate importance Representative Comments DISTRICT 49 SHOULD MAINTAIN A CALENDAR WHERE STUDENTS ATTEND SCHOOL ON VETERANS DAY Veterans day is a wash for me because I would love the day off for us to spend as a family as my husband is in the military but I love the programs put on by the schools too DISTRICT 49 SHOULD CHANGE THE CALENDAR TO CLOSE SCHOOL ON VETERANS DAY Please do not change our calendar except for closing our school for Veterans Day out of respect for our wonderful heroes in our community SPRING BREAK 72 support to maintain  very high importance Representative Comments DISTRICT 49 SHOULD MAINTAIN A TWOWEEK SPRING BREAK FROM LATE MARCH TO EARLY APRIL The calendar as it now stands is one of the single biggest reasons we chose to send our children to school in District 49 Other district calendars did not have the benefits that 49 has We especially like the shorter summer break and the extra other breaks throughout the school year Especially the 2week Oct break that allows for vacations during cheaper offseason times without taking our children out of school DISTRICT 49 SHOULD CHANGE THE CALENDAR  REDUCE SPRING BREAK TO ONE WEEK IN LATE MARCH I think two week fall and spring breaks are too long Id prefer to have one week during those times and allow children to start school later Calendar Survey Results  Next Steps Clear consensus emerged around maintaining the existing calendar breaks Many comments particularly from staff members mentioned the break structure as an important factor in choosing District 49 as a place to work There was some consensus although not as strong around remaining in school for Veterans Day Many schools in the district use the day as a teaching opportunity with visits from active and former service members and educational learning taking place in Veterans Day assemblies There wasnt any clear consensus regarding professional development days although many comments mentioned that unifying teacher work days across the zones would make it easier for families with regards to scheduling District 49 leaders will present the survey results and any recommended changes to the calendar during the Board of Education meeting on January 14 If changes are proposed the BOE may choose to vote on accepting the changes during their meeting in February Get in Touch 10850 East Woodmen Road Peyton CO 80831 7194951100 Download on the App

Brochurepdf 45315 KB Last Modified on April 15 2015 Comments 1 Gifted QA What is giftedness Posted by As a parent we all believe our children are gifts and possess very special traits that make them unique and extraordinary However in the education world the term gifted has come to mean children who demonstrate high performance in specific areas or domains or who have the potential for exceptional performance At this time gifted education is unfortunately not mandated by the federal government Therefore you will find states throughout our nation vary greatly in how they identify gifted students and the programming opportunities provided to meet the unique learning needs of these children To see a more detailed response to this question click this link to visit the NAGC National Association of Gifted Children webpage  Comments 1 111 How do I know if my child is gifted Posted by There are many characteristics and traits gifted children often demonstrate Parents are

our students and staff to be healthy For the 20232024 school year we have implemented many things into our Health and Wellness program This Fall we welcomed Landsharks Running Club into our school The students had a great time going to practices building camaraderie and feeling the sense of accomplishment at the competitions A second round of Landsharks has continued this Spring and we hope to continue it in the 20242025 school year If you have a child that loves to run or just simply has lots of energy Landsharks may be a great fit for them We also know that with living in Colorado comes unpredictable weather and freezing temperatures which causes us to stay inside for recess To help keep our minds engaged we have purchased and put together Indoor Recess Carts These carts contain a variety of ageappropriate games and activities for students to choose from when they cannot go outside We have found they have been helpful in building concepts like taking turns and working together Grades 35 are thoroughly engaged in the games while grades K2 love something simple like coloring To help encourage our staff to stay healthy we started with ensuring they were able to stay hydrated Getting the daily amount of water as a teacher can be difficult some days Therefore we provided each staff member with a water bottle with motivational statements that helped encourage them to drink more water We also know the winter months can be hard to get exercise so staff had the opportunity to participate in the Falcon Zones Biggest Loser Competition We were able to provide incentives to those winners that competed throughout the zone Our Health and Wellness committee has many things yet to accomplish and we look forward to implementing them in the 20242025 school year Comments 1 At BRES we have worked hard to make sure our traffic pattern is safe for both students parents and staff Here is a brief movie that explains how dropoff and traffic patterns work at our school Here are

Bennett Ranch Elementary loves to ensure that we are doing our best to encourage our students and staff to be healthy For the 20232024 school year we have implemented many things into our Health and Wellness program This Fall we welcomed Landsharks Running Club into our school The students had a great time going to practices building camaraderie  and feeling the sense of accomplishments at the competitions A second round of Landsharks has continued this Spring and we hope to continue it in the 20242025 school year If you have a child that loves to run or just simply has lots of energy Landsharks may be a great fit for them We also know that with living in Colorado comes unpredictable weather and freezing temperatures which causes us to stay inside for recess To help keep our minds engaged we have purchased and put together Indoor Recess Carts These carts contain a variety of age appropriate games and activities for students to choose from when they cannot go outside We have found they have been helpful in building concepts like taking turns and working together Grades 35 are thoroughly engaged in the games while grades K2 love something simple like coloring To help encourage our staff to stay healthy we started with ensuring they were able to stay hydrated Getting the daily amount of water as a teacher can be difficult some days therefore we provided each staff member with a water bottle with motivational statements that helped encourage them to drink more water We also know the winter months can be hard to get in exercise so staff had the opportunity to participate in the Falcon Zones Biggest Loser Competition We were able to provide incentives to those winners that competed throughout the zone Our Health and Wellness committee has many things yet to accomplish and we look forward to implementing them in the 20242025 school year Wellness Policy Overview District 49s wellness policy and supporting guidelines focus on improving the health of

PeanutTreenut Allergies Our population of students includes some with severe lifethreatening allergies to any product containing peanuts or tree nuts ie walnuts pistachios cashews almonds coconuts etc In order to assure their safety please assign deliberate attention when packing student snacks and lunches A comprehensive and regularly updated Guide of Snacks Free of Peanuts Tree Nuts and Eggs can be accessed by clicking on httpsnacksafelycomsafesnackguide  Please note Although this guide also lists foods that are free of eggs our environment only needs to be free of peanuts and tree nuts Items containing egg are safe Any food items with obvious peanut tree nut ingredients will be temporarily confiscated and then returned at the end of the program day Medication Policy Please be aware that Colorado State law governs our medication policy Students are not permitted by law to carry on them or hold in their backpacks any overthecounter medications Tylenol Advil Sudafed cough drops etc Parents are welcome to come and administer their students medication onsite and in such an event we request that this is done in the health room If your child must take medication during school hours and you will not be coming in to administer it you must provide the following before we administer it A written doctors order including drug name dose time duration of treatment doctors and parents signature This includes all overthecounter medication and essential oils The only exception is cough drops which may be given with written parent permission The physician may email the order to the school PLEASE NOTE The pharmacy label applied to the medication bottle will not suffice for a doctors order Medication must be in the original bottle complete with label Medication cannot be given if it comes in a baggie envelope plain bottle etc All medications must be kept in a locked cabinet in the health room If a student must carry medication with him or her such as an inhaler EpiPen or Diabetes supplies the physician order must state so The medications provided to the health room will not be available outside of school hours For after school activities parents should discuss health conditions with the staff member who is in charge of that activity We are happy to coordinate training of staff but please be aware that staff does not have after school access to the health room supplies If your child has a health condition such as asthma allergies diabetes or seizure disorder a health care plan will need to be devised This gives guidance to the staff regarding your childs health issues Please contact the school health assistant immediately if this pertains to your student Please consult the District 49 Nursing Services Webpage at httpwwwd49orgdomain261 to print off and prepare any documents that may be needed for your child Immunizations All students must have current and uptodate immunizations in order to participate in school The only exception to this is if the parents turn in a certificate of exemption for medical religious or personal reasons For further information click on the nursing services under the student service tab on the main page All students need to be compliant with their immunizations or they will be excluded from attending school Your nurse or health assistant will contact you soon after the beginning of the school year to inform you if your child is out of compliance meaning he or she is missing immunizations If you have any questions regarding these policies or immunization requirements for Colorado students please call the health room Birthday Celebrations The District 49 Wellness and Nutrition policy outlines the kinds of food items that are acceptable for our special celebrations which include parties and birthdays The guidelines include a list of acceptable food items that cannot exceed 100 calories have 0 trans fat and ideally contain less than 4 grams of fat and less than 9 grams of sugar Due to these new guidelines and our already foodsensitive student population we are not allowing students to bring in any edible treats for birthdays and other celebrations Please consult the nonfood celebration items

learning needs of these children To see a more detailed response to this question click this link to visit the NAGC National Association of Gifted Children webpage  Comments 1 111 How do I know if my

unique and extraordinary However in the education world the term gifted has come to mean children who demonstrate high performance in specific areas or domains or who have the potential for

gifted students and the programming opportunities provided to meet the unique learning needs of these children To see a more detailed response to this question click this link to visit the NAGC National Association of Gifted Children webpage  Comments 1 111 How do I know if my child is gifted Posted by There are many characteristics and traits gifted children often demonstrate Parents are

family you dont know anyone at all You have no friends you have no one to talk with and you know nothing about the school you are about to enter the neighborhood you live in and the community you just moved into Moving to a new place and adjusting to a new school new teachers and finding new friends are daunting and scary experiences for most schoolage children especially if the child faces the experience more than once Believing that transitioning does not have to be difficult just different S2S or Student2Student is a unique studentled school managed program that confronts the challenges of transition and provides relevant training that gives students the best possible transition experience A team of volunteer students supervised by a school counselor teacher or other school staff

feel welcomed comfortable included and accepted into their new school community For the outgoing student the team assists in helping outbound students better prepare for transitioning to another school S2S is a powerful program designed to help change a transitioning students focal point from what the student has lost to what the student will gain through the relocation S2S guides students through their uncertain surroundings offering  from a peer viewpoint  valued information friendship and assistance in three areas that matter most to transitioning students How do I find my way around Who will I meet How will I make friends What about my relationships What do I need to know about the academic requirements at this school Contact your school to find out how to get involved Get in

District 49 is a way of doing business to support every student While this can be a formal process in its most basic form MTSS is also how schools link assessment and instruction on the Colorado Academic Standards on a daytoday basis The goal is to continue to improve outcomes for each individual student and all students Schools use data and information in a systematic way to determine whats working and whats not to make realtime adjustments in instruction Many times instruction can be adjusted to meet the needs of learners but when needs become apparent schools provide interventions to increase support Resources for intervention come from the curriculum or other school resources from the zone and district as additional supports are needed as applicable Partnering with parents is KEY for success Our teachers and schools rely on parents and guardians input to best serve their children so in District 49 we communicate frequently to connect parents to the learning process You can
